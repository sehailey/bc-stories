## Welcome to Stories.

To submit a story on the "Add" page, enter your name and
details. All of your data will be encrypted before being sent to
the server using an automatically-generated password, which will
be given to you, along with the SHA256 hash value of the
encrypted story.

When you're ready to retrieve your story, you will need the
password and the hash value. Without these, the data are unable
to be retrieved.
